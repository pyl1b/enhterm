    A command.

    The only requirement for implementations of this class is to implement
    the :meth:`~execute` method. The command loop will take the returned
    value of this method and deposit it into the `result` member.

    An implementation can be as simple as:
    >>> from enhterm.command import Command
    >>> class PrintCommand(Command):
    >>>     def execute(self):
    >>>         print("Hello world")

        term (EnhTerm):
            The terminal that is executing this command. Prior to
            :meth:`~execute` this value is set by the terminal.
        provider:
            The :class:`~enhterm.provider.Provider` instance that generated
            this command. The terminal only sets this value to point to the
            active provider if it is found to be `None` prior to :meth:`~execute`.
        result:
            The result of :meth:`~execute`, `None` until then.
